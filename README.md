# simulation-driving-car-using-neural-networks
An AI model that can drive a car on a simulation using tensorflow with python 

https://s4.dosya.tc/server9/fcmo9n/evaotonom.zip.html <-- this is the link for the simulation it requires unity engine to work 

first you need to collect data 

you can start by opening the game then resize it to 800x640 and make sure that it's placed in the top left corner of the screen 

then open main.py to start collecting data !!!NOTE it could take from 2 to 3 hours to fininsh 40000 amount of data you can pause by pressing T
you need like 150k data for a decent model 

then make sure to balance the data in balance_data.py 

when you finish all the steps, just simply start training your modle in train_model_alexnet.py

all done 
if you want to test the model you can do that by opening test_model.py
